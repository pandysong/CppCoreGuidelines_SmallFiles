### <a name="Rs-file-suffix"></a>SF.1: Use a `.cpp` suffix for code files and `.h` for interface files if your project doesn't already follow another convention

##### Reason

It's a longstanding convention.
But consistency is more important, so if your project uses something else, follow that.

##### Note

This convention reflects a common use pattern:
Headers are more often shared with C to compile as both C++ and C, which typically uses `.h`,
and it's easier to name all headers `.h` instead of having different extensions for just those headers that are intended to be shared with C.
On the other hand, implementation files are rarely shared with C and so should typically be distinguished from `.c` files,
so it's normally best to name all C++ implementation files something else (such as `.cpp`).

The specific names `.h` and `.cpp` are not required (just recommended as a default) and other names are in widespread use.
Examples are `.hh`, `.C`, and `.cxx`. Use such names equivalently.
In this document, we refer to `.h` and `.cpp` as a shorthand for header and implementation files,
even though the actual extension may be different.

Your IDE (if you use one) may have strong opinions about suffices.

##### Example

    // foo.h:
    extern int a;   // a declaration
    extern void foo();

    // foo.cpp:
    int a;   // a definition
    void foo() { ++a; }

`foo.h` provides the interface to `foo.cpp`. Global variables are best avoided.

##### Example, bad

    // foo.h:
    int a;   // a definition
    void foo() { ++a; }

`#include <foo.h>` twice in a program and you get a linker error for two one-definition-rule violations.

##### Enforcement

* Flag non-conventional file names.
* Check that `.h` and `.cpp` (and equivalents) follow the rules below.

### <a name="Rs-inline"></a>SF.2: A `.h` file may not contain object definitions or non-inline function definitions

##### Reason

Including entities subject to the one-definition rule leads to linkage errors.

##### Example

    // file.h:
    namespace Foo {
        int x = 7;
        int xx() { return x+x; }
    }

    // file1.cpp:
    #include <file.h>
    // ... more ...

     // file2.cpp:
    #include <file.h>
    // ... more ...

Linking `file1.cpp` and `file2.cpp` will give two linker errors.

**Alternative formulation**: A `.h` file must contain only:

* `#include`s of other `.h` files (possibly with include guards)
* templates
* class definitions
* function declarations
* `extern` declarations
* `inline` function definitions
* `constexpr` definitions
* `const` definitions
* `using` alias definitions
* ???

##### Enforcement

Check the positive list above.

### <a name="Rs-declaration-header"></a>SF.3: Use `.h` files for all declarations used in multiple source files

##### Reason

Maintainability. Readability.

##### Example, bad

    // bar.cpp:
    void bar() { cout << "bar\n"; }

    // foo.cpp:
    extern void bar();
    void foo() { bar(); }

A maintainer of `bar` cannot find all declarations of `bar` if its type needs changing.
The user of `bar` cannot know if the interface used is complete and correct. At best, error messages come (late) from the linker.

##### Enforcement

* Flag declarations of entities in other source files not placed in a `.h`.

### <a name="Rs-include-order"></a>SF.4: Include `.h` files before other declarations in a file

##### Reason

Minimize context dependencies and increase readability.

##### Example

    #include <vector>
    #include <algorithm>
    #include <string>

    // ... my code here ...

##### Example, bad

    #include <vector>

    // ... my code here ...

    #include <algorithm>
    #include <string>

##### Note

This applies to both `.h` and `.cpp` files.

##### Note

There is an argument for insulating code from declarations and macros in header files by `#including` headers *after* the code we want to protect
(as in the example labeled "bad").
However

* that only works for one file (at one level): Use that technique in a header included with other headers and the vulnerability reappears.
* a namespace (an "implementation namespace") can protect against many context dependencies.
* full protection and flexibility require modules.

**See also**:

* [Working Draft, Extensions to C++ for Modules](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/n4592.pdf)

##### Enforcement

Easy.

### <a name="Rs-consistency"></a>SF.5: A `.cpp` file must include the `.h` file(s) that defines its interface

##### Reason

This enables the compiler to do an early consistency check.

##### Example, bad

    // foo.h:
    void foo(int);
    int bar(long);
    int foobar(int);

    // foo.cpp:
    void foo(int) { /* ... */ }
    int bar(double) { /* ... */ }
    double foobar(int);

The errors will not be caught until link time for a program calling `bar` or `foobar`.

##### Example

    // foo.h:
    void foo(int);
    int bar(long);
    int foobar(int);

    // foo.cpp:
    #include <foo.h>

    void foo(int) { /* ... */ }
    int bar(double) { /* ... */ }
    double foobar(int);   // error: wrong return type

The return-type error for `foobar` is now caught immediately when `foo.cpp` is compiled.
The argument-type error for `bar` cannot be caught until link time because of the possibility of overloading, but systematic use of `.h` files increases the likelihood that it is caught earlier by the programmer.

##### Enforcement

???

### <a name="Rs-using"></a>SF.6: Use `using namespace` directives for transition, for foundation libraries (such as `std`), or within a local scope (only)

##### Reason

 `using namespace` can lead to name clashes, so it should be used sparingly.
 However, it is not always possible to qualify every name from a namespace in user code (e.g., during transition)
 and sometimes a namespace is so fundamental and prevalent in a code base, that consistent qualification would be verbose and distracting.

##### Example

    #include <string>
    #include <vector>
    #include <iostream>
    #include <memory>
    #include <algorithm>

    using namespace std;

    // ...

Here (obviously), the standard library is used pervasively and apparently no other library is used, so requiring `std::` everywhere
could be distracting.

##### Example

The use of `using namespace std;` leaves the programmer open to a name clash with a name from the standard library

    #include <cmath>
    using namespace std;

    int g(int x)
    {
        int sqrt = 7;
        // ...
        return sqrt(x); // error
    }

However, this is not particularly likely to lead to a resolution that is not an error and
people who use `using namespace std` are supposed to know about `std` and about this risk.

##### Note

A `.cpp` file is a form of local scope.
There is little difference in the opportunities for name clashes in an N-line `.cpp` containing a `using namespace X`,
an N-line function containing a `using namespace X`,
and M functions each containing a `using namespace X`with N lines of code in total.

##### Note

[Don't write `using namespace` in a header file](16_SF_Source_files.md#Rs-using-directive).

##### Enforcement

Flag multiple `using namespace` directives for different namespaces in a single source file.

### <a name="Rs-using-directive"></a>SF.7: Don't write `using namespace` at global scope in a header file

##### Reason

Doing so takes away an `#include`r's ability to effectively disambiguate and to use alternatives. It also makes `#include`d headers order-dependent as they may have different meaning when included in different orders.

##### Example

    // bad.h
    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std; // bad

    // user.cpp
    #include "bad.h"

    bool copy(/*... some parameters ...*/);    // some function that happens to be named copy

    int main() {
        copy(/*...*/);    // now overloads local ::copy and std::copy, could be ambiguous
    }

##### Enforcement

Flag `using namespace` at global scope in a header file.

### <a name="Rs-guards"></a>SF.8: Use `#include` guards for all `.h` files

##### Reason

To avoid files being `#include`d several times.

In order to avoid include guard collisions, do not just name the guard after the filename.
Be sure to also include a key and good differentiator, such as the name of library or component
the header file is part of.

##### Example

    // file foobar.h:
    #ifndef LIBRARY_FOOBAR_H
    #define LIBRARY_FOOBAR_H
    // ... declarations ...
    #endif // LIBRARY_FOOBAR_H

##### Enforcement

Flag `.h` files without `#include` guards.

##### Note

Some implementations offer vendor extensions like `#pragma once` as alternative to include guards.
It is not standard and it is not portable.  It injects the hosting machine's filesystem semantics
into your program, in addition to locking you down to a vendor.
Our recommendation is to write in ISO C++: See [rule P.2](03_P_Philosophy.md#Rp-Cplusplus).

### <a name="Rs-cycles"></a>SF.9: Avoid cyclic dependencies among source files

##### Reason

Cycles complicates comprehension and slows down compilation.
Complicates conversion to use language-supported modules (when they become available).

##### Note

Eliminate cycles; don't just break them with `#include` guards.

##### Example, bad

    // file1.h:
    #include "file2.h"

    // file2.h:
    #include "file3.h"

    // file3.h:
    #include "file1.h"

##### Enforcement

Flag all cycles.


### <a name="Rs-implicit"></a>SF.10: Avoid dependencies on implicitly `#include`d names

##### Reason

Avoid surprises.
Avoid having to change `#include`s if an `#include`d header changes.
Avoid accidentally becoming dependent on implementation details and logically separate entities included in a header.

##### Example

    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;

    void use()                  // bad
    {
        string s;
        cin >> s;               // fine
        getline(cin, s);        // error: getline() not defined
        if (s == "surprise") {  // error == not defined
            // ...
        }
    }

`<iostream>` exposes the definition of `std::string` ("why?" makes for a fun trivia question),
but it is not required to do so by transitively including the entire `<string>` header,
resulting in the popular beginner question "why doesn't `getline(cin,s);` work?"
or even an occasional "`string`s cannot be compared with `==`).

The solution is to explicitly `#include <string>`:

    #include <iostream>
    #include <string>
    using namespace std;

    void use()
    {
        string s;
        cin >> s;               // fine
        getline(cin, s);        // fine
        if (s == "surprise") {  // fine
            // ...
        }
    }

##### Note

Some headers exist exactly to collect a set of consistent declarations from a variety of headers.
For example:

    // basic_std_lib.h:

    #include <vector>
    #include <string>
    #include <map>
    #include <iostream>
    #include <random>
    #include <vector>

a user can now get that set of declarations with a single `#include`"

    #include "basic_std_lib.h"

This rule against implicit inclusion is not meant to prevent such deliberate aggregation.

##### Enforcement

Enforcement would require some knowledge about what in a header is meant to be "exported" to users and what is there to enable implementation.
No really good solution is possible until we have modules.

### <a name="Rs-contained"></a>SF.11: Header files should be self-contained

##### Reason

Usability, headers should be simple to use and work when included on their own.
Headers should encapsulate the functionality they provide.
Avoid clients of a header having to manage that header's dependencies.

##### Example

    #include "helpers.h"
    // helpers.h depends on std::string and includes <string>

##### Note

Failing to follow this results in difficult to diagnose errors for clients of a header.

##### Enforcement

A test should verify that the header file itself compiles or that a cpp file which only includes the header file compiles.

### <a name="Rs-namespace"></a>SF.20: Use `namespace`s to express logical structure

##### Reason

 ???

##### Example

    ???

##### Enforcement

???

### <a name="Rs-unnamed"></a>SF.21: Don't use an unnamed (anonymous) namespace in a header

##### Reason

It is almost always a bug to mention an unnamed namespace in a header file.

##### Example

    ???

##### Enforcement

* Flag any use of an anonymous namespace in a header file.

### <a name="Rs-unnamed2"></a>SF.22: Use an unnamed (anonymous) namespace for all internal/nonexported entities

##### Reason

Nothing external can depend on an entity in a nested unnamed namespace.
Consider putting every definition in an implementation source file in an unnamed namespace unless that is defining an "external/exported" entity.

##### Example

An API class and its members can't live in an unnamed namespace; but any "helper" class or function that is defined in an implementation source file should be at an unnamed namespace scope.

    ???

##### Enforcement
