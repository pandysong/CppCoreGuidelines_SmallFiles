### <a name="Ra-stable"></a>A.1: Separate stable from less stable part of code

???

### <a name="Ra-lib"></a>A.2: Express potentially reusable parts as a library

##### Reason

##### Note

A library is a collection of declarations and definitions maintained, documented, and shipped together.
A library could be a set of headers (a "header only library") or a set of headers plus a set of object files.
A library can be statically or dynamically linked into a program, or it may be `#include`d


### <a name="Ra-dag"></a>A.4: There should be no cycles among libraries

##### Reason

* A cycle implies complication of the build process.
* Cycles are hard to understand and may introduce indeterminism (unspecified behavior).

##### Note

A library can contain cyclic references in the definition of its components.
For example:

    ???

However, a library should not depend on another that depends on it.
